Stern-Brocot Sequence is a sequence similar to fibanocci series. A sequence ‘a’ is built using the following rules:
a0 = 0

a1 = 1

a2i = ai

a2i+1 = ai + ai+1

For example, the sequence of numbers 1, 1, 2, 1, 3 is a Stern-Brocot Sequence and 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4 is not a Stern-Brocot Sequence since the eigth element is not as per rule. Given ‘n’ numbers write a C++ code to find out if it can be a Stern-Brocot Sequence when taken in order.

Input Format

First line contains the number of elements, n

Next line contains the elements separated by a space

Output Format

Print Yes if the elements form Stern-Brocot Sequence and print No and the index of the first element which violates the rule

Program

n=int(input())
data=list(map(int,input().split()))
x=1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i==1 and data[i-1]!=1:
        x=0
        break
    elif (i)%2==0:
        y=(i)//2
        if data[y-1]!=data[i-1]:
            x=0
            break
    elif (i)%2!=0 and i!=1:
        y=(i)//2
        if (data[y-1]+data[y])!=data[i-1]:
            x=0
            break
if x==1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
    print(i)
