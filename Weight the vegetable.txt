Question: 
  
Weigh the Vegetables

A vegetable whole sale vendor got a request to supply ‘n’ vegetables each of quantity ‘x’ kg from the chef of a hotel. A lorry was loaded with the packets of ‘n’ vegetables each weighing ‘x’ kg and sacks of all ‘n’ vegetables to be preserved in the godown. They had two weighing stones of weight w1 and w2. When they reached the hotel a new list with different weights were given to the vendor. All new weights are greater than or equal to ‘x’. The vendor will deliver the packed vegetables. In addition, the excess quantity in the new list will be exactly delivered if they can be weighed with weighing stones w1 and w2. The vegetables are weighed using the weighing stones only and the weighing stones can be used many times. Given the value of x, w1, w2 and a set of new weights, write a C++ program to find the weight of vegetables that can be delivered.

For example, if x is 10, w1 is 3, w2 is 7 and the new weights are 19, 22, 21, 24 then the weight of vegetables that will be exactly delivered are 19, 22, 24.

Input Format

First line contains the value of x

Next line contains the value of w1

Next line contains the value of w2

Next line contains the value of n

Next line contains value of n values separated by a space

Output Format

Print 1 for weights that can be exactly weighed and 0 otherwise



PROGRAM:
	
s=int(input())
w1=int(input())
w2=int(input())
nc=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
ans=[]
for i in range(nc):
    x=l[i]-s
    while x>=0:
        if x%w1==0:
            print("1",end=' ')
            break
        x-=w2
    else:
        print("0",end=' ')
